These go here
color.py  --  /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/homeassistant/util/
tplink.py  --  /usr/local/lib/python3.4/dist-packages/homeassistant/components/light/
pyhs100 (folder)  --  /home/<USERNAME>/.homeassistant/deps
configuration.yaml  --  /home/<USERNAME>/.homeassistant
groups.yaml  --  /home/<USERNAME>/.homeassistant
weblinks.yaml  --  /home/<USERNAME>/.homeassistant


Make sure the atributes match the originals or other files in the folders. (ex. rights, owner)

I have a secret.yaml file for all the private info which goes in the   --  /home/<USERNAME>/.homeassistant

Must install "future" also to make the TPLink stuff to work
